## Introduction
In this hypothetical scenario, a successful Chinese restaurant is looking to expand their business into a new city in the United States. 

This Szechuan restaurant was opened up in 2013 at a college town and sooner become one of most popular Chinese restaurants in town. Recently, the owners would like to expand the family business to West Coast. Los Angeles, California is the first choice.

The owners had conducted market research and is confident that the taste of their restaurant would be the dominator in town. However, not knowing the city well, the owners have difficulties to identify the best neighborhood to open their business.

Based on the familyâ€™s experiences with their restaurant, seeking out an area that already attracts diners who enjoy Chinese cuisine would be a good indicator for the location of the new restaurant.

## Approach
For the purposes of this project this problem will be investigated using the Foursquare API to identify which neighborhoods meet the preferences outlined by the client.
